# Glide Components

Welcome to the **Glide Components** library! This is a comprehensive SwiftUI component library designed to provide consistent, accessible, and beautiful UI components for your applications.

## What's Inside

Our component library includes:

- **Buttons** - Multiple styles (primary, secondary, destructive) and sizes
- **Cards** - Flexible container components with consistent styling
- **Text Fields** - Styled input fields with various keyboard types

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add this package to your Xcode project:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(path: "path/to/GlideComponents")
]
```

### Basic Usage

```swift
import SwiftUI
import GlideComponents

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var text = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        GlideCard {
            VStack(spacing: 16) {
                Text("Welcome to Glide")
                    .font(.title2)
                    .fontWeight(.bold)
                
                GlideTextField("Enter text", text: $text)
                
                GlideButton("Submit", style: .primary) {
                    print("Submitted: \\(text)")
                }
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

## Design System

All components follow consistent design principles:

- **iOS-native styling** that adapts to system appearance
- **Accessibility first** with proper VoiceOver support
- **Flexible customization** while maintaining design consistency
